## PyKaruiFlow

PyKaruiFlow is a university project. In this project a computational 
graph with backpropagation support is implemented.

This is a Python version of the upcoming KaruiFlow implementation with CUDA. The
goal of this Python version is to determine the API, overall functionality and get to understand
how computational graphs (and backpropagation) work under the hood.

## Installation

- pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/oKatanaaa/PyKaruiFlow.git
