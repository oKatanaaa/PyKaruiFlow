## PyKaruiFlow

PyKaruiFlow is a university project. In this project we are trying to imitate
the famous PyTorch framework for educational purposes and find an answer to
the following questions:
- how does computational graph work?
- how does backpropagation work?
- how PyTorch does everything dynamically compared to TensorFlow 1.x?

This is a Python version of the upcoming KaruiFlow implementation with CUDA. The
goal of this Python version is to determine the API and overall functionality as well as
figure out the theory behind computational graphs and backpropagation.

This implementation surely won't be as performant or flexible as PyTorch, but it won't contain
any boilerplate (or autogenerated) code or be as massive. Although some technical effort will be put
into designing KaruiFlow, still it must be great for educational purposes and help a lot to 
understand how different frameworks work under the hood.
